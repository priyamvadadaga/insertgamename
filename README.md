Introduction to Computer Science, Final Project, Fall 2020.
A 3 level game made on Processing with Python 3.


A zoom-themed game where the user will be able to walk through the window and collect different items like Clap, Thumbs Up, Party reactions to enter mini games and earn Raised Hands to unlock levels. Initially, only one mini game available. If the player wins a mini game, they collect a Raised Hand and a Heart, and if they lose, they lose one Heart. Heart is the indicator of a player's “health”, and when it is 0, the main character dies from zoom fatigue and the game ends. Players will also have the ability to choose one of the two sprites in the beginning of the game and upon restart. Users will have the option to restart after losing and also at any point of the game. Players can also save the progress to later continue the game from where they left off. There are 3 levels (thus, 3 mini games) in total. The game is accompanied by sound effects.


## How to Play ##

1. Choose your sprite.
2. Use arrow keys to move around. 
3. Collect items (claps / thumbs ups/ partys) to enter mini-game. 
4. Enter unlocked breakout rooms to play mini-games and follow on-screen instructions.
5. To unlock games, collect raised hands by winning previously unlocked mini-games.
